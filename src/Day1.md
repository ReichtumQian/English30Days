## Recite: Success in Life

主题：个人

Success means different things for different people.
Some may **equate** it with **fame**, some with wealth and still some
with **accomplishments**.

For me, it means fulfilling one's dreams. Whatever your dreams are, you
have a goal there and then focus all your attention on it.

Dreams bring you hope and happiness. In the process of struggling for it,
you cry, sweat, complain or even curse, but the joy of harvesting makes
you forget all the pains and troubles you have gone through. So an old
proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the
bitterest ordeal.

There are several keys to success. First, your goal must be practical and
practicable. If you set your goal too high, chances are that you will never
attain it. Next, you have to make a plan of doing it. You can take some
steps to realize it. Since the process is quite tough, you need to be
diligent, patient and persevering.

Even if you meet with some difficulties or frustrations, just take them in
your stride. You can always tell yourself that there is nothing
insurmountable. With this will and determination, success is sure to wait
for you at the end of the tunnel!
