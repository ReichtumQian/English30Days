## Recite: Jogging

Every day, in all kinds of weather, thousands of men and women go 
jogging. Why has jogging—running slowly for long distances—become 
so popular? Most joggers like it because they have heard it is a very 
good exercise. Jogging makes the heart stronger and helps people lose 
weight. It can also help them feel better about themselves.  

How fast should you go? Jog with a friend and talk to each other as you 
run. If you have difficulty talking, you are going too fast. How far should 
you jog? Remember not to go too far too soon. In fact you should walk, 
not run, the first few times. Then do some short jogs, but no more than 
what you can do comfortably.  

After that, increase your distance a quarter or half of a mile every two 
weeks or so. Maybe in a few years, you, too, can run in a marathon like 
thousands of other people do.
