- Some may equate it with fame, some with wealth and still some with accomplishments.
- In the process of struggling for it, you cry, sweat, complain or even curse, 
but the joy of harvesting makes you forget 
all the pains and troubles you have gone through.
- So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.
- First, your goal must be practical and practicable.
- You can take some steps to realize it.
- Since the process is quite tough, you need to be diligent, patient and persevering.
- Even if you meet with some difficulties or frustrations, just take them in your stride.
- You can always tell yourself that there is nothing insurmountable.
