## Recite: Learning is a Lifelong Career

As food is to the body, so is learning to the mind. Our bodies grow
and muscles develop with the **intake** of food. **Likewise**, we should keep
learning day by day to maintain our mental power and expand our
**intellectual** capacity.

Constant learning supplies us with fuel for driving us to sharpen our
power of reasoning, analysis, and judgement. Continuous learning is the
best way to **keep pace with** the times in the information **age**.

It is a common misunderstanding to regard school as the only place
for the **acquisition** of knowledge. **On the contrary**, learning should be an
endless process, from the **cradle** to the grave. With the world changing
so fast, to stop learning for just a few days will make a person **lag** behind.

Lack of learning will inevitably lead to the **stagnation** of the mind, or
even worse, its **fossilization**. Therefore, to stay mentally young, we have
to take learning as a lifelong career.

I think governments should encourage companies to adopt a four-day work week but not force them.

Research has shown that shorter work weeks can increase productivity and reduce stress.

This could also provide workers with more time for their personal lives.

### Do you often feel bored?

Yeah, absolutely. I believe everybody does, right?

Boredom is a kind of feeling that we get all the time, 
so I suppose I feel bored just from time to time in a day. 
I mean, sometimes in the mid-afternoon, 
I just feel like if I'm not super busy and if I have nothing better to do, 
I just feel like, oh my God, what am I supposed to do right now? 

So yeah, of course, I believe I'm the same as everybody else. 
I get bored all the time. 

### When was the last time you felt bored? 

Oh, it was actually just about 5 minutes ago,
when I was waiting out there for you to come out and get me.
Because I didn't have my phone and 
there was no one next to me that I could talk to. 
So I felt super bored.

### what do you do when you feel bored? 

Well, in most cases, when I feel like I have nothing better to do, 
I just, well, I just use my phone to read some news, 
you know, there's an app on my phone called Jin Ri Tou Tiao today's Headlines or something like that. 
This is my favorite app because I can read a lot of news articles on various things, on entertainment, on sports, politics, and so on. 
So yeah, these are the things I do to drive away boredom.

The chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of
telephone calls in the UK, divided into three categories, from 1995-2002.

The bar chart compares the amount of time spent by people in the UK on
three different types of phone call between 1995 and 2002.

It is clear that calls made via local, fixed lines were the most popular
type, in terms of overall usage, throughout the period shown. The lowest
figures on the chart are for mobile calls, but this category also saw the
most dramatic increase in user minutes.

In 1995, people in the UK used fixed lines for a total of just over 70
billion minutes for local calls, and about half of that amount of time
for national or international calls. By contrast, mobile phones were only
used for around 4 billion minutes. Over the following four years, the
figures for all three types of phone call increased steadily.

By 1999, the amount of time spent on local calls using landlines had
reached a peak at 90 billion minutes. Subsequently, the figure for this
category fell, but the rise in the other two types of phone call continued.
In 2002, the number of minutes of national / international landline calls
passed 60 billion, while the figure for mobiles rose to around 45 billion
minutes.

Question: Several languages are in danger of extinction 
because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. 
Some people say that governments should 
spend public money on saving these languages, 
while others believe that would be a waste of money.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.

It is true that some minority languages may disappear in the near future. 
Although it can be argued that governments could save money 
by allowing this to happen, 
I believe that these languages should be protected and preserved.

There are several reasons why saving minority languages 
could be seen as a waste of money. 
Firstly, if a language is only spoken by a small number of people, 
expensive education programs will be needed to make sure that more people learn it,
and the state will have to pay for facilities, teachers and marketing. 
This money might be better spent on other public services. 
Secondly, it would be much cheaper and more efficient 
for countries to have just one language. 
Governments could cut all kinds of costs 
related to communicating with each minority group. 

Despite the above arguments, 
I believe that governments should try to 
preserve languages that are less widely spoken. 
A language is much more than simply a means of communication; 
it has a vital connection with the cultural identity of the people who speak it. 
If a language disappears, 
a whole way of life will disappear with it, 
and we will lose the rich cultural diversity 
that makes societies more interesting. 
By spending money to protect minority languages, 
governments can also preserve traditions, customs and behaviors 
that are part of a country’s history.

In conclusion, it may save money in the short term 
if we allow minority languages to disappear, 
but in the long term this would have an 
extremely negative impact on our cultural heritage.
