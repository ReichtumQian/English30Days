## Recite: Body Language

Americans feel that physical contact can be important in 
breaking down barriers between people. 
Such physical acts as hugging, 
shaking hands and kissing in public 
are seen as displays of affection.

In China, on the other hand, 
this is not common because physical contact is not the custom. 
Interestingly enough, 
most Chinese who spend some time in America 
come to like hugging; 
they learn that Americans use body language to express feelings. 
It is a way of saying “I like you and I care about you.”

Shaking hands is another traditional way of greeting someone in America. 
Shaking hands is a more formal way of greeting than hugging.
Whereas hugging shows closeness, 
shaking hands means that there is 
a little more formality in the relationship.

Western people usually shake hands 
when meeting someone for the first time, 
or when they see someone again after a certain amount of time has passed. 
In Japan, people traditionally bow as a form of greeting. 
Other countries have different customs, 
like patting someone on the back or kissing.

I quite like looking at myself in the mirror.

It's a chance for me to check my appearance and make sure everything is in order.

I pay attention to details like whether 
my collar is straight or if my makeup is applied evenly.

## Recite: SIMON Part2-3

Question: Some people believe that studying at university or college 
is the best route to a successful career, 
while others believe that it is better to 
get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.

When they finish school, 
teenagers face the dilemma of whether to 
get a job or continue their education. 
While there are some benefits to 
getting a job straight after school, 
I would argue that it is better to 
go to college or university.

The option to start work straight after
school is attractive for several reasons. 
Many young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. 
In this way, they can become independent, 
and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. 
In terms of their career, 
young people who decide to find work, 
rather than continue their studies, 
may progress more quickly. 
They will have the chance to gain real experience 
and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession.
This may lead to promotions and a successful career.

On the other hand, 
I believe that it is more beneficial for students 
to continue their studies. 
Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. 
For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, 
teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. 
As a result, 
university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities,
and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications.
Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, 
and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. 
Young people who do not have qualifications 
from a university or college will not be able to compete.

For the reasons mentioned above, 
it seems to me that students are more likely to 
be successful in their careers 
if they continue their studies beyond school level.

## Recite: 杨帅 Part1 colors

What's your favorite color? 

Well, there are many colors that I really like, including blue, green, black, red, and yellow. But if I had to pick a favorite, I suppose, and should be red because it's considered to be the most auspicious color in China, and also it's associated with happiness. Everybody wants to be happy. I want to be happy. So that's why red is my favorite color. 

Do you like dark colors? Well, like I said just now, I like black and brown. Did I say I like black and brown? I don't really remember, so yeah, I guess I do like dark colors, but just not as much as bright colors, You know, sometimes when I go shopping, if I see a dark green or dark blue piece of clothing, if it looks beautiful, I will buy it. So it doesn't matter if it's that dark. I don't, I don't really care. 

Are there any colors you dislike? Perhaps green, especially if it's a green hat, I don't like it because in China in our culture, green hats are associated with infidelity. If I wore a green hat, it would mean that my girlfriend had cheated on me, and that wouldn't be very good, right? 

Do you usually wear clothes in your favorite color? Well, I have many favorite colors, there's not one color that I like the most, so yeah, I don't really know how to answer this question, I wear clothes of various colors and I love a wide range of colors.
