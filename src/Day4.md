## Recite: Body Language

Americans feel that physical contact can be important in 
breaking down barriers between people. 
Such physical acts as hugging, 
shaking hands and kissing in public 
are seen as displays of affection.

In China, on the other hand, 
this is not common because physical contact is not the custom. 
Interestingly enough, 
most Chinese who spend some time in America 
come to like hugging; 
they learn that Americans use body language to express feelings. 
It is a way of saying “I like you and I care about you.”

Shaking hands is another traditional way of greeting someone in America. 
Shaking hands is a more formal way of greeting than hugging.
Whereas hugging shows closeness, 
shaking hands means that there is 
a little more formality in the relationship.

Western people usually shake hands 
when meeting someone for the first time, 
or when they see someone again after a certain amount of time has passed. 
In Japan, people traditionally bow as a form of greeting. 
Other countries have different customs, 
like patting someone on the back or kissing.

I quite like looking at myself in the mirror.

It's a chance for me to check my appearance and make sure everything is in order.

I pay attention to details like whether 
my collar is straight or if my makeup is applied evenly.
